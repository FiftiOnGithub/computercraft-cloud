# getfile

This is the source code repository for getfile. For runtime, only the actual "compiled" file is to be used, the other files in this repository are for context. the uncompiled source code is not intended for use by production clients.

The "aeslua" file is stored here for ease-of-access, but likewise is not actually needed for either of the programs to run. They both contain the aeslua code inside themselves.
